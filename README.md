# TDI-derived-Thalamic-Atlas

The atlas is a freely available manually drawn parcellation of thalamic nuclei based on a high-resolution group template obtained from the 100 unrelated subjects HCP release. 
Bilateral thalami have been manually parcellated into 13 structures (anterior, centromedian-parafascicular, habenula, lateral dorsal, lateral geniculate, mediodorsal-centrolateral, mediodorsal, medial geniculate, midline nuclei, pulvinar, ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral posterior). 

A probabilistic version of the same atlas based on manual parcellation of individual TDI from 6 HCP subjects (3 males, 3 females) is also available.

A detailed description of the pipeline used to produce the maps is provided in:
